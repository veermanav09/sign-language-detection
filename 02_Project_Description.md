# Project Description

**SignSpeak** is an autonomous sign language to speech translation system based on **3D hand pose estimation** and AI-driven gesture recognition.

The system captures hand gestures through a camera, extracts 3D hand landmarks, classifies the gestures using a trained neural network, and converts the recognized signs into audible speech in real time.
