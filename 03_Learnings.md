# Learnings

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in:

- Understanding the limitations of 2D gesture recognition systems
- Implementing real-time **3D hand landmark detection**
- Designing an AI pipeline for gesture classification
- Integrating computer vision with machine learning models
- Building a complete sign-to-speech pipeline
- Deploying AI systems using a web-based interface

We also learned about performance optimization, latency handling, and modular system design to support scalability and future enhancements.
