# Project Basics and Literature Review

## Literature Review Summary

Existing research highlights that:
- 3D hand pose estimation significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy
- Dataset diversity is limited, affecting generalization
- Real-time sign-to-speech systems are computationally demanding
- Most studies focus on sign-to-text rather than sign-to-speech
- Cross-lingual adaptability is largely unexplored

## Observed Limitations
- Lack of diverse and annotated datasets
- High computational requirements
- Focus on isolated tasks instead of end-to-end solutions
- Limited real-world testing

## Need for the Project

Current solutions do not offer a complete, real-time sign-to-speech translation system. This motivated the development of **SignSpeak**, which integrates 3D hand pose estimation with speech synthesis to provide a practical and inclusive communication tool.
