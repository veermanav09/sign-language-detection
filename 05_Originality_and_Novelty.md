# Originality and Novelty of the Work

SignSpeak introduces several novel aspects:

- **End-to-End Real-Time Translation** from gesture to speech
- **3D Hand Pose Estimation** for higher accuracy over 2D systems
- **Integrated Audio Feedback**, enhancing usability and accessibility
- **Web-Based Interface**, enabling easy deployment and usage
- **Modular Architecture**, allowing easy expansion and maintenance

The system achieves high accuracy with low latency, making real-time sign-to-speech interaction practical for everyday use.
